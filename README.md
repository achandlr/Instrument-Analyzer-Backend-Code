This repository contains a collection of coding projects focused on musical instruments. 
Included in the projects are:
1. A database of thousands of instruments with maker names, country built, location made, and year made, along with photos of the instrument. 
2. Convolutional neural networks that can predict an instrumentâ€™s price, age, and location built.
3. A mp4 file showing an instrument guessing game with thousands of images.

My website showing some of the code is: instrumentappraiser.com

Before now, there was no publicly available database for stringed instuments. A history of over 400 years of violin making has led to the existence of billions of dollars worth of instruments. I wrote code to assemble 150 million dollars worth of instruments into a pandas database. I made data visualizations of the violin trade. I made an inflation estimator for all instruments. I designed and implemented a convolutional neural network to predict the worth of an instrument, and most recently, a GUI to guess instruments.

Included:
Visualizations of Spread of Violins over time
Data preprocessing
Convolutional Neural Network to predict worth of instrument with data generation.
Novel violin inflation statistics for investors

Not Included:
WebScraping Code
Wolfram Data city to country converter.
GUI code for the guessing game
