"# Violin-Project-Code" 

Here is my website for this code: instrumentappraiser.com

Before now, there was no publicly available database for stringed instuments. A history of over 400 years of violin making has led to the existence of billions of dollars worth of instruments. I wrote code to assemble 150 million dollars worth of instruments into a pandas database. I made data visualizations of the violin trade. I made an inflation estimator for all instruments. I designed and implemented a convolutional neural network to predict the worth of an instrument. 

Included:
Visualizations of Spread of Violins over time
Data preprocessing
Convolutional Neural Network to predict worth of instrument with data generation.
Novel violin inflation statistics for investors

Not Included:
WebScraping - 1000 lines of code.
Wolfram Data city to country converter.
